# Multi-omics-for-rice-germination
This is a final year student project conducted by 4 students in Data science at AgroParisTech starting from november 2018, in the line of a research project on rice germination from the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). The project focuses on applying and developping machine learning methods to integrate metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data during rice germination.
